# Approximating PI using Monte Carlo method in ASP.NET Core

This project is about appoximating the PI number using Monte Carlo method. If you dont know what that is, look [here](http://www.eveandersson.com/pi/monte-carlo-circle) for some theory.
The project should compile in Microsoft Visual Studio (I used 2015 version).

This version is implemented in ASP.NET Core and it's using MVC. I also made [WebForms version of this application](https://github.com/MaciejWanat/WebMonteCarloPI).

Application will ask you how many points to draw and how wide area should it use. You can observe how approximation gets more and more accurate when you increase area or number of points.

This is an online version. It should be online at this address:
